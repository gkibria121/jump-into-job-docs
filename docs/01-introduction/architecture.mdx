# Job Portal Microservice Architecture

## Architecture Overview

The Job Portal platform is built on a robust microservices architecture that enables scalability, resilience, and maintainability. Each service is designed with a specific domain responsibility and communicates with other services through a message queue system (NATS Streaming).

- Performance monitoring
- Error tracking
- Alerting system
- Distributed tracing

### DevOps Pipeline

- Containerization (Docker)
- Orchestration (Kubernetes)
- CI/CD pipeline
- Infrastructure as Code
- Blue/Green deployment

## Service Communication Patterns

### Asynchronous Communication

- Event-driven architecture via NATS Streaming
- Command pattern for specific service instructions
- Saga pattern for distributed transactions

## Scalability Considerations

- Horizontal scaling of individual services
- Database sharding for high volume data
- Read replicas for heavy read operations
- CDN for static content delivery
- Auto-scaling based on traffic patterns

## Resilience Patterns

- Circuit breaker pattern
- Retry with exponential backoff
- Bulkhead pattern
- Fallback mechanisms
- Health checks and self-healing

## Data Consistency

- Event sourcing for critical workflows
- CQRS pattern for separation of read/write operations
- Eventual consistency across services
- Compensating transactions for failure recovery

## Implementation Technologies

### Backend

- Node.js/Express for microservices
- Laravel PHP for legacy integration (if needed)

## Development Workflow

1. Feature development in isolated services
2. Local testing with service mocks
3. Integration testing in development environment
4. Automated testing in CI pipeline
5. Deployment to staging environment
6. Performance testing
7. Deployment to production with canary release

## API Versioning Strategy

- Backward compatibility maintenance
- Deprecation policy and timeline
- API documentation with version history

## Future Architectural Considerations

- GraphQL API layer for flexible data queries
- Serverless functions for specific workloads
- AI service for advanced matching algorithms
- Blockchain integration for credential verification
- Edge computing for global performance optimization

## Compliance and Regulations

- GDPR compliance measures
- Data retention policies
- User consent management
- Regional data storage requirements
- Audit logging for sensitive operations
