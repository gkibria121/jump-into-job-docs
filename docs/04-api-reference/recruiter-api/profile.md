## Profile Management Best Practices

- **Regular Updates**: Ensure your profile is always up-to-date with current contact information, job posting status, and recruitment needs.
- **Profile Visibility**: Set your profile status to **active** when you're recruiting actively, or **inactive** when you're not looking for candidates.
- **Job Posting Management**: Keep track of job posting status and ensure it reflects the actual hiring situation.
